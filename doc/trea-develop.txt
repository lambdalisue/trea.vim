	This feature has strongly inspired by t9md/vim-choosewin.

					*trea-develop-window-locator*
	Window locator is used to select an anchor window automatically.
	It find all suitable window; a window which is not 'previewwindow' and

			{url}.

	And the instance has the following methods:

	Name		Description~
	"to_string()"	Return |String| representation of the instance.

	The {url} is assumed to follow the syntax of a generic URI which
	syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of five components:
>
	URI = SCHEME:[//AUTHORITY]PATH[?QUERY][#FRAGMENT]
<
	where the AUTHORITY components divides into three subcomponents:
>
	AUTHORITY = [USERINFO@]HOST[:PORT]
<
	For example
>

				*trea#message#info()*
				*trea#message#title()*
				*trea#message#error()*
				*trea#message#debug()*
trea#message#info({object}...)
trea#message#title({object}...)
trea#message#error({object}...)
trea#message#debug({object}...)
	Show |String| representation of each {object} when Vim is idle.
	The info shows without higlight.
	The title shows with |hl-Title|.
	The error shows with |hl-Error|.
	The debug shows with |hl-Comment| when |g:trea_debug| is TRUE.

				*trea#scheme#{scheme}#provider#new()*
trea#scheme#{scheme}#provider#new()
	Return a provider instance (|trea-develop-provider|) of the {scheme}.

=============================================================================
PROVIDER					*trea-develop-provider*

A provider instance must have the following methods.

				*trea-develop-provider.get_node()*
.get_node({url})		
	Return a (partial) node instance of the {url} (|String|).
	It throws error when no node is found for the {url}.

	The node instance MUST have the following attributes.

	"name"		The name of the node (required)
	"status"	1/0 to indicate if the node is branch (required)

	And may have the following attributes.

	"label"		Label to display the node in a tree view
	"hidden"	1/0 to indicate if the node should be hidden
	"bufname"	Buffer name used to open the node or |v:null|
	"_{ANY}"	Scheme specific variables (e.g. "_path" in file)

	The partial node will be filled by trea to become |trea-develop-node|.

				*trea-develop-provider.get_parent()*
.get_parent({node}, {token})
	Return a promise which is resolved to a parent node of the {node}.
	It resolves the {node} itself when the {node} does not have parent.

	The {token} is CancellationToken which can be used to cancel the
	internal process. Use ... to ignore that argument.

				*trea-develop-provider.get_children()*
.get_children({node}, {token})
	Return a promise which is resolved to a list of child nodes of the
	{node}. It rejects when the {node} is leaf node.

	The {token} is CancellationToken which can be used to cancel the
	internal process. Use ... to ignore that argument.

=============================================================================
NODE						*trea-develop-node*

A node instance is a tree item which has the following attributes:

Name		Description~
"name"		A |String| name of the node. This value is used in "__key"
		thus must be unique among nodes which has same "__owner".

"status"	A |Number| which indicates the node status. One of the
		followings:
		|g:trea#internal#node#STATUS_NONE|	Leaf node
		|g:trea#internal#node#STATUS_COLLAPSED|	Branch node (close)
		|g:trea#internal#node#STATUS_EXPANDED|	Branch node (open)

"label"		A |String| used to display the node in a tree view.

"hidden"	A 1/0 to indicate if the node should be hidden. All hidden
		nodes become visible once trea enter hidden mode.

"bufname"	A |String| buffer name used to open the node or |v:null|.
		This value is used when users want to enter a branch node so
		scheme developers SHOULD assign a proper value to this
		attribute. Otherwise users cannot enter the branch node.

"processing"	A |Number| which indicate that the node is in processing.
		If the value is greater than 0, a spinner is displayed in sign
		area of the node to indicate that the node is processing.

"__key"		A |List| of |String| which represents the location of the
		node in the tree.
		This value is automatically assigned by trea and developers
		should NOT touch unless for debugging purpose.

"__owner"	An owner node instance of the node in the tree.
		This value is automatically assigned by trea and developers
		should NOT touch unless for debugging purpose.

"__cache"	A |Dict| used to cache value. Only attribute names of this
		field are shown in debug output so developers should store
		complex values which may failed to display in this field.

"__promise"	A |Dict| used to store processing promise. Only attribute
		names of this field are shown in debug output so developers
		should store temporary promise in this field.

"_{XXX}"	Any attribute starts from a single underscore (_) is opened
		for each scheme. Note that any complex value should be stored
		in "__cache" instead to avoid display error.
